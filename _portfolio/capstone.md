*  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Introduction</b><br>Project Onion was developed as an advanced cruise missile (ALCM) with capabilities tailored to NATO’s strategic requirements. The objective was to design a stealthy, high-maneuverability, long-range missile with versatile deployment capabilities from multiple aircraft. Traditional cruise missiles often sacrifice maneuverability for stealth, or vice versa, limiting their versatility in dynamic combat situations. Project Onion sought to overcome these limitations, making it an ideal weapon system for military applications that require flexibility, enhanced survivability, and extensive range.</p>
  
* <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Method</b><br>The design process started with benchmarking against existing models, particularly the AGM-158 JASSM and AGM-86 ALCM, to understand state-of-the-art features and design requirements. We implemented a forward-swept wing with low RCS (Radar Cross-Section) to enhance stealth and agility. The unique forward-swept wing configuration, while uncommon, was selected for its advantageous lift-to-drag ratio and aerodynamic efficiency, particularly at lower speeds. Folding wing mechanisms were also integrated, ensuring compatibility with aircraft like the B-52 and F/A-18 for air-to-ground operations. Extensive aerodynamic analyses were conducted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to optimize wing performance and structural integrity, while FEA (Finite Element Analysis) validated the missile’s endurance under high aerodynamic loads.</p>

* <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Results</b><br>Through iterative testing and analysis, the missile’s forward-swept wing design showed improved agility and range without compromising stealth. The missile achieved a favorable balance between stability and maneuverability across various flight phases, meeting NATO’s maneuverability benchmarks. Material testing confirmed that the chosen materials could withstand the loads experienced in high-speed, high-maneuver scenarios without significant fatigue or deformation. Furthermore, the low RCS configuration demonstrated substantial reductions in detectability in radar simulations, fulfilling stealth requirements critical to modern warfare.</p>

* <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Discussion</b><br>Project Onion’s unique design combines the strengths of agility, low radar visibility, and adaptable deployment options, making it an ideal choice for missions demanding flexibility and survivability. The forward-swept wing, a novel choice in missile design, proved effective for the intended operational contexts, aligning with NATO’s focus on adaptable and versatile weaponry. The folding wings enhance compatibility with multiple aircraft, adding strategic flexibility. This project highlights the potential for innovation in missile design, with structural and material selections that optimize performance while maintaining the balance between durability and agility.</p>
