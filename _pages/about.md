Welcome Qihan's Webpage!

Here is my [Resume](/wqh.github.io/files/Resume.pdf)!

I am Qihan Wang. I am currently pursuing my Master degree in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics, Controls, and manipulation from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, US. I completed my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering & Aeronautical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, NY, US. I am interested in Robotics and wish to make a difference and contribute positively to society. I am seeking full-time jobs in Robotics field, especially in controls and design.

I am currently working as part of the Depowdering Team in CERLAB under MechE department in CMU, focusing on automating the process of grasping and handling 3D-printed metal objects. The ultimate goal of our work is to successfully extract 3D-printed parts from surrounding metal powder using a specially designed wire gripper and transfer them to a designated storage area. I developed an algorithm that automatically generates grasping positions for arbitrary 3D objects by processing their input .stl files. The method projects the 3D mesh onto a 2D bitmap to extract object contours, applies morphological dilation and curvature analysis to identify and filter grasp point candidates, and selects valid grasp quadruples through geometric constraints centered on the object centroid. After that, I validated grasp configurations through physics-based simulations in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, achieving robust and stable results across diverse geometries. Currently, I am extending this work by formulating a nonlinear objective function to further optimize grasp selection using advanced optimization techniques. I also designed the electronic control system for the actuator using Arduino and integrated it with the Robot Operating System (ROS) to enable seamless operation. This work combines algorithmic innovation with hardware design to advance automation in depowdering processes.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and Julia, and also tools such as Matlab and ROS. I also have experience in working with simulation platforms like RViz, ISAAC and Webot. Furthermore, I have background in machine learning, deep learning and deep reinforcement learning.

Thank you for reading my page. I am looking forward to hear from any opportunities!
