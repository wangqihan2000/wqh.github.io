Welcome Qihan's Webpage!

Here is my [Resume](/files/Resume.pdf)

I am Qihan Wang. I am currently pursuing my Master degree in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Robotics, Controls, and manipulation from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, US. I completed my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering & Aeronautical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, NY, US. I am interested in Robotics and wish to make a difference and contribute positively to society. I am seeking full-time jobs in Robotics field, especially in controls and design.

I am currently working as part of the Depowdering Team, focusing on automating the process of grasping and handling 3D-printed metal objects. The ultimate goal of our work is to successfully extract 3D-printed parts from surrounding metal powder using a specially designed wire gripper and transfer them to a designated storage area. I am developing an algorithm that automatically generates grasping positions for any 3D object by processing its input .stl file. This involves generating candidate grasping points through 2D contour analysis, reducing the points based on convex and concave corner theory, and applying a 3D occupancy grid to evaluate geometric constraints. Currently, I am formulating a nonlinear objective function to optimize the grasping process, leveraging advanced optimization techniques to achieve reliable results. Beyond algorithm development, I have designed and manufactured a four-wire gripper powered by a linear actuator. I also designed the electronic control system for the actuator using Arduino and integrated it with the Robot Operating System (ROS) to enable seamless operation. This work combines algorithmic innovation with hardware design to advance automation in depowdering processes.

In terms of skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and Julia, and also tools such as Matlab and ROS. I also have experience in working with simulation platforms like RViz, ISAAC and Webot. Furthermore, I am skilled in CAD software like SolidWorks and UGNX.

Thank you for reading my page. I am looking forward to hear from any opportunities!
